Whenever a channel is declared, whatever may be its type memory is allocated.
But When Empty Struct is Used as Type, no memory is allocated and is used as only Signal only Channel.

Below select pattern does not deadlocks
- If u include for loop than also won't deadlock
func main() {
	ch := make(chan int)

	select {
	case <-ch:
		fmt.Println("waiting for value")
	default:
		fmt.Println("no deadlocks")
	}
}
